HashSlinger is a command line tool for computing hashes of files.
Any hash type supported by the .Net CryptoTransform classes
may be computed (MD5 is the default).
It can treat multiple files as a continuous stream, so it can be used
to verify the integrity of large files that have been split.
A class library (HashSlingerCore.dll) is available for developers (MIT X11 licensed).

Version 4.0 of the .Net framework is required.

Visual C# 2010 Express (with SP1), NUnit 2.5, Warsetup 3.13, and Wix 3.5 were used
to build, and test the project.

Usage:

   hashslinger [-a {MD5|MD160|SHA1|SHA256|SHA384|SHA512}] [-b blocksize] [-c] file [file2 ...]

Options:
        -a, --algorithm         Sets hash algorithm. Default is MD5.
        -b, --blocksize         Block size in bytes. Default is 16384.
        -c, --concat            Treat all files as a single stream. Default is false.

Example:

   hashslinger -a MD5 -b 65536 foo.txt

Computes MD5 hash for foo.txt using a 65536 byte transform block.

Example 2:

   hashslinger -c foo.txt foo2.txt

Computes MD5 hash for foo.txt and foo2.txt as if they were one continous file.
Can be used to determine if a file (ie if foo.txt and foo2.txt are parts
of a large media file created by a filesplitter) was split properly.
